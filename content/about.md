## Hey, i'm SteelPh0enix AKA Wojciech Olech

I live in Poland. At the moment i'm a student at [Lublin University of Technology](http://en.pollub.pl/), doing my Master's Degree in IT.
I also work part-time at [STMicroelectronics](https://www.st.com/) as Trainee/Technical Support Engineer.

At free time i'm usually messing with random code, writing guides or shitposting.

Main technologies i'm working in, or messing with, are:

* C/C++ - my main programming languages
* Python - a little bit, if i need something done real quick
* Qt - for GUI and a bit more advanced apps
* Embedded - STM32, mostly, as it's pretty great and well supported platform. And also i work in the company that makes them, but i'd use these MCUs anyway.
* Windows and Linux - installing, setting them up, and such things.

There are some other minor langs and tech i know, but the list would get really long if i'd wanted to write them down.

TL;DR i'm mostly low-level guy that likes to work on a hardware.
